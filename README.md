![](https://ss.modmuss50.me/javaw_2019-05-22_20-33-34.jpg)

__Note:__ This project is not related or supported by either Fabric or Optifine.

__Note:__ This project does not contain Optifine, you must download it separately!

## Installing

After installing fabric for 1.14, you will need to place the OptiFabric mod jar as well as the optifine installer in the mods folder.

Note currently only fabric api 0.2.7 is supported, you can download it from [here](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/fabric/files/2702281). This will be fixed soon.

## Issues

If you happen to find an issue and you believe it is to do with OptiFabric and not Optifine or a mod please open an issue [here](https://github.com/modmuss50/OptiFabric/issues) 


Note Fabric, Optifine and OptiFabric are still all in beta, so things will be broken.
